# Shell Basics

## List All Files and subdirectory 
 ```
 #!/bin/bash 
 # this show the location of bash sheel 
 pwd # this shows the absolute path of a dir
 ```

 ## List Content Of A dir 
 ```
  #!/bin/bash 
  ls  # shows the content of a dir
 ```

 ## Back to home 
 ``` 
    #!bin/bash 
    cd ~
 ```

 ## List file in human readable format 
 ``` 
 #!/bin/bash
 ls -l # this option  `l` format the output using `long format` list ever thing related to the file or dir 
 ```

 ## List all files including hidden file in long format 
 ``` 
 #!/bin/bash 
 ls -la # the option `a` tells `ls` to also include hidden files 
 ```

 ## List hidden file, long format and users and group ids in numeric format 
 ``` 
 #!/bin/bash //shebang #! 
 ls -na // the `n` option is like 'l' option but lists the user and group ids in numbers hope that makes sense 
 ``` 

## hope this works
``` 
 #!/bin/bash 
 mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory/
 ```
